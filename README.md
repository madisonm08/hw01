# Biography: Madison Martin
My name is Madison Martin, 
*but I also go by Maddie as well*.
I will respond to either name. 
I am in the MAPSS program and pursuing the certificate in Computational Social Science.
Through this class, and over the course of the MAPSS program, I am hoping to:

1. be introduced to the R programming language and gain coding skills 

2. find new tools to improve my efforts in pyschological research, including my master's thesis project 

3. expand my conception and uderstanding of the role of data in social science
