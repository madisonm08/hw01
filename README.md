# Biography: Madison Martin
My name is Madison Martin, 
*but I also go by Maddie as well*.
I will respond to either name, I'm really not that picky. 
I am in the MAPSS program and am pursuing the certificate in Computational Social Science.
My main research interests are stigma, prejudice, and discrimination in academic and workplace contexts.
Through this class, and over the course of the MAPSS program, I am hoping to:

1. be introduced to the R programming language and gain coding skills 

2. find new tools to improve my efforts in pyschological research, including my master's thesis project 

3. expand my conception and understanding of the role of data in social science

In my spare time, I like to sing, go to concerts (House of Blues is my **favorite** venue), collect pins, and volunteer at animal shelters.
